        <p><b>Foods and Their Cost:</b><br><tab>Our</tab> study of consists of two different foods: fried chicken and chicken nuggets. Prices of these foods vary based on which fast-food restaurant is selling them. At McDonald’s, Burger King, and Chick-Fil-A, a single chicken nugget costs about 45 ¢, 15 ¢, and 38 ¢, respectively. At KFC, fried chicken is sold in many combo meals whose prices range from $1.50 to $29.99.<br><br><b>Energy Density:</b><br><tab>Energy</tab> density consists of the amount of kilocalories a food has per one gram of that food. One serving size of chicken nuggets is about 5 nuggets, which is equivalent to about three ounces. Three ounces can be converted to roughly 85 grams. The amount of kilocalories in this serving are 180. So chicken nuggets have an energy density of 2.12 kcal/g. On the other hand, fried chicken has the same serving size with 3 ounces or 85 grams. It has a slightly larger amount of kilocalories, coming in at 215. Therefore the fried chicken has an energy density of 2.53 kcal/g. This means that fried chicken has a higher energy density than chicken nuggets. This also means that one would have to eat 101 grams of chicken nuggets to get the same amount of energy as eating 85 grams of fried chicken.<br><br><b>Carbon Footprint:</b><br><tab>For</tab> the most basic production of chicken nuggets, a producer will require an automatic meat grinder, an automatic meat vacuum tumbler, a meat shaping machine, a frying and powder coating machine, a flour and frying machine, and a freezing machine. Using the power consumptions of one of each of these machines the total power per year to run a basic chicken nugget factory would be 62388 kilowatts. This roughly translates to 260688 tons of carbon emissions per year.<br><tab>Fried</tab> chicken does not require as many machines, however, the machines used in the most basic production of fried chicken require more energy to operate. To produce fried chicken at the most basic level industrially the required machinery is a rotating seasoning machine, a rotating flouring and breading machine, an industrial deep fryer, and an industrial gas-fired oven. The total power usage to produce fried chicken is 67340 kilowatts per year. Converted to tons of carbon emissions produced the number is larger than chicken nuggets at 281380 tons of gas per year.<br><tab>Therefore,</tab> the carbon footprint of producing fried chicken is only slightly greater than producing chicken nuggets. This did not account for the greenhouse gases given off at the chicken farms before the factory because both industries require chicken farms, therefore, they would not affect the difference between the two products.<br><br><b>Food Tests:</b><br><tab>Each</tab> food, the nuggets and fried chicken, was sliced up and blended into water to dilute the solutions. The dilution was then poured into test tubes, 5 for each food, and each test tube received a different food test. All of these tests were done with just a couple drops of the testing chemicals.  None of these tests quantified the results they only gave an indication of the concentration of the nutrient that was being tested for.<br></p>
        <div align = "middle"><div id = "img1"></div></div>
        <p><tab>This</tab> test was done with Sudan III and was meant to reveal the concentration of lipids within each food. The solution on the left is the fried chicken and it’s very obvious that a thick red line has formed at the top of it, much thicker than the test tube on the left which is the chicken nuggets. This thicker red line indicates that the fried chicken has substantially more lipids than the chicken nuggets. Now whether or not there is too much lipids was not determined by this test, it only indicates that the fried chicken has more lipids. It’s important to note that lipids is a very general term and not all lipids are bad for your health so more doesn’t necessarily mean worse healthwise.<br></p>
        <div align = "middle"><div id = "img2"></div></div>
        <p><tab>This</tab> test is a Biuret test and it indicates the level of protein in each food. On the right is the chicken nuggets and that solution is just slightly more blue than the fried chicken, this indicates that the chicken nuggets contain more protein than the fried chicken. That being said the difference is almost negligible and neither contains a whole lot of protein.<br></p>
        <div align = "middle"><div id = "img3"></div><div id = "img4"></div></div>
        <p><tab>These</tab> images are from a test for sugar using Benedict’s solution. Both tests tubes were placed in a boiling beaker for three minutes after a few drops of Benedict’s were added to each test tube. In the second photo the chicken nuggets are on the right and they are just a little less red than the fried chicken solution, this indicates that there is more sugar in the fried chicken.<br></p>
        <div align = "middle"><div id = "img5"></div></div>
        <p><tab>The</tab> fourth and final food test utilized Iodine to test for starch. The fried chicken is the test tube on the left and it’s plain to see that is much darker and therefore has a much higher concentration of starch. This starch likely doesn’t come from the chicken meat but the breading of the chicken and this makes sense because the fried chicken has a lot more breading on it than the chicken nuggets. While starches are good sources of energy, when it is deep fried in oil, like both of these foods, it is not a healthy source of starch. So in the case of these two foods more starch is worse.<br><br><b>Agricultural and Environmental Effects:</b><br><tab>Both</tab> of these foods come from one common main ingredient: chicken. Poultry production in the United States is either raising egg hens or broiler chickens for meat. Both of the products that are being investigated in this case are meat and most likely come from broiler chickens.<br><tab>Broiler</tab> chickens have been genetically modified and fed so many growth hormones that they are 4.6x the weight they were in 1957. These chickens are barely able to stand in the mass pens they are kept in. These broiler chicken farms have skyrocketed in the amount of chickens raised over the past 60 years, from 580 million to 9 billion today in the United States. And these mass chicken farms produce a lot of waste, in Maryland and Delaware alone 523 million broiler chickens are raised. And these chickens produce roughly 42 million cubic feet of litter per year. This is a massive amount of waste and a good amount of it ends up in the Chesapeake Bay, which is now an threatened environment because of this. This is just the effect of one example of the devastating effect broiler chicken farming can have on the environment.<br><tab>Chicken</tab> waste can contaminate groundwater and be harmful to humans upon consumption. When chicken manure is put in soil it can be a great natural fertilizer but  when chicken waste is dumped in mass quantities by farms it over fertilizes the soil and renders it useless. Additionally chicken farming can contaminate the air, ammonia can be released along with ‘poultry dust’ both of these can damage human lungs. Chicken farming can also release nitrogen oxides which contribute to the greenhouse effect and climate change.<br><br><b><big>Chicken Nuggets</big></b><br>Serving size: 5 each (~3 oz.)<br><b>Calories: </b>180 kcal<br><b>Total Fat:</b> 7.9987 g<br><tab>Saturated</tab> fat: 1.0543 g<br><tab>Trans</tab> fat: 0 g<br><b>Cholesterol:</b> 19.9973 mg<br><b>Sodium:</b> 449.9262 mg<br><b>Carbohydrates:</b> 14.0006 g<br><tab>Dietary</tab> fiber: 1.9989 g<br><b>Protein:</b> 13.0012 g<br><tab>Iron:</tab> 1.7973 mg<br><tab>Calcium:</tab> 39.9946 mg<br><tab>Vitamin A:</tab> 0 IU<br><tab>Vitamin C:</tab> 0 mg<br><br><b><big>Fried Chicken</big></b><br>Serving size: 3 oz<br><b>Calories: </b>215 kcal<br><b>Total Fat:</b> 13 g<br><tab>Saturated</tab> fat: 3 g<br><tab>Trans</tab> fat: 0 g<br><b>Cholesterol:</b> 41 mg<br><b>Sodium:</b> 591 mg<br><b>Carbohydrates:</b> 11 g<br><tab>Dietary</tab> fiber: 1 g<br><b>Protein:</b> 12 g<br><tab>Iron:</tab> 1 mg<br><tab>Calcium:</tab> 12 mg<br><tab>Vitamin A:</tab> 78 IU<br><tab>Vitamin C:</tab> 1 mg<br><br><b>Nutritional Analysis</b><br><tab>Based</tab> on the nutrition facts of a 3 ounce serving of both fried chicken and chicken nuggets from the West High School Cafeteria, the fried chicken has 35 more calories per serving than the chicken nuggets. Additionally, the total fat of the fried chicken is 5 grams more than that of the chicken nuggets, and the saturated fat is nearly twice as much. The fried chicken also contains 41 mg of cholesterol to the chicken nuggets’ 20. Both food options have high sodium contents, with the fried chicken containing 591 mg of sodium, and the chicken nuggets containing 450 mg.<br><tab>The</tab> chicken nuggets, however, have a lower carbohydrate concentration than the fried chicken, with 14 grams and 11 grams, respectively. The chicken nuggets contain nearly twice as much dietary fiber as the fried chicken, with 2 grams in the nuggets, and 1 in the fried chicken. The protein content of each are relatively similar; the chicken nuggets having 13 grams to the fried chicken’s 12. The chicken nuggets have a higher concentration of iron and a significantly higher concentration of calcium, but the fried chicken has substantially more Vitamin A. Both have little to no Vitamin C, however.<br><tab>The</tab> three nutrients from which humans derive energy are carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, however, all of these are in different quantities. In terms of a 2000 calorie diet, one serving of fried chicken has approximately ¼ of the total recommended daily value of fat, whereas the chicken nuggets have only about 16%. Carbohydrates should be eaten in the highest quantity, and both of these food choices have only approximately 5% of the recommended daily value. Depending on what type of exercise one does, the protein content in each ranges anywhere from 8%-26% of the recommended daily value.<br><br><b>Conclusion:</b><br><tab>To</tab> summarize, both foods have their ups and downs. The unit price of a chicken nugget is about $1.05 cents cheaper than that of a piece of fried chicken. Fried chicken, however, has a 0.41 kcal/g higher energy density than chicken nuggets. From the food tests, we were also able to determine information about these two different foods. Fried chicken, based on the results of our tests, had substantially more lipids, sugar, and starch than the chicken nuggets. Based on the tests, we also determined that the chicken nuggets were found to have more protein than the fried chicken.<br><tab>Based</tab> on the findings from our research, we concluded that the better option when choosing between fried chicken and chicken nuggets is the chicken nugget. The chicken nugget industry leaves a smaller carbon footprint than the fried chicken industry, contains less unhealthy starches, contains fewer sugars, and has slightly more proteins than fried chicken. With all of this taken into account choosing chicken nuggets is better for the consumer's health and for our environment.<br><br><b>Works Cited</b><br>UK, NHS. “Starchy Foods and Carbohydrates.” NHS UK, NHS, 31 Mar. 2017, www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/starchy-foods-and-carbohydrates/.<br><br>Festante, Jim. “Chickens Today Are Shockingly Bigger Than They Used To Be.” Business Insider, Business Insider, 15 Nov. 2014, www.businessinsider.com/chicken-breed-sizes-and-weight-over-time-2014-11?r=UK&IR=T.<br<br>Big Chicken: Pollution and Industrial Poultry Production in America.” The Pew Charitable Trusts, 26 July 2011, www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/reports/2011/07/26/big-chicken-pollution-and-industrial-poultry-production-in-america.<br><br>Blue, Marie-Luise. “Ecological Impact of Chicken Farming.” Sciencing.com, Sciencing, 25 Apr. 2017, sciencing.com/ecological-impact-chicken-farming-5005.html.<br><br>“McDonalds Prices”  fastfoodmenuprices.com, Fast Food Menu Prices. https://www.fastfoodmenuprices.com/mcdonalds-prices/<br><br>‘Burger King Prices” fastfoodmenuprices.com, Fast Food Menu Prices. https://www.fastfoodmenuprices.com/burger-king-prices/<br><br>‘Chick-fil-a Prices” fastfoodmenuprices.com, Fast Food Menu Prices. https://www.fastfoodmenuprices.com/chick-fil-a-prices<br><br>‘KFC Prices” fastfoodmenuprices.com, Fast Food Menu Prices. https://www.fastfoodmenuprices.com/kfc-prices/<br><br>https://www.slcschools.org/departments/business-administration/child-nutrition/school-menus/ <br>http://www.schoolnutritionandfitness.com/webmenus2/#/product/583f3421eabc882f088b458a?escapeMode=back  (Fried Chicken)<br><br>http://www.schoolnutritionandfitness.com/webmenus2/#/product/583f3421eabc882f088b45a0?escapeMode=back (Nuggets)<br><br>https://healthyeating.sfgate.com/recommended-fats-carbohydrates-proteins-sodium-4478.html<br><br>“Carbon Footprint Factsheet.” Biofuels Factsheet | Center for Sustainable Systems, css.umich.edu/factsheets/carbon-footprint-factsheet.<br><br>“E-Commerce Company.” Www.alibaba.com, www.alibaba.com/product-detail/IQF-quick-freezer-tunnel-quick-freezing_60745062377.html?spm=a2700.7724838.2017115.85.4a336dfbANSzoB.<br><br>“How Much Electricity Does It Use?” How Much Electricity Does It Use?, www.cryer.co.uk/brian/misc/how_much_electricity.htm.<br><br>“KFC Chicken Processed and Cooked in a Factory Video- Inside Production Kitchen.” YouTube, KFC Chicken Videos, 29 Sept. 2013, www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTdOLSzxH0k.<br><br>“Setting Up Chicken Nugget Factory.” Financial Tribune, 5 Oct. 2015, financialtribune.com/articles/economy-business-and-markets/27226/setting-up-chicken-nugget-factory.</p>
